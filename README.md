ScholarshipSystem
=================
It's a readme!

This is eloy-chan talking to you from the Terminal! 
Alice is right next to me! 
Let's work hard everyone :3

Time for a real readme

Now that we have class files, if you want to work on them there are options.
For everything, do it from YOUR FORK.

In the list of files you should see a folder OOP/src/ScholarshipSystem, which contains the .java files.
If you click on any one of them, you can

a) Click the monitor icon to "Open this file in Github for Mac/Windows"
b) Click the pencil to edit it in the browser.

Committing changes made via b) is straightforward; at the bottom of your screen is a conveniently labeled button.

Committing changes made via a) can be done through the Github GUI or through
 Git (the command line). 

GUI: Clicking the monitor icon should open the file in
 whatever your default editor is. You can make your changes and save the file.
 It will then appear in the GUI as a new, uncommitted change, which you can
 then commit through the interface by checking its box, adding your summary
 and description and clicking 'commit'. Then switch to the History tab
 (sorry I don't know what any of this looks like on Windows....), where you
 should see a circle on the side of that commit indicating it hasn't yet
 been pushed to the remote (online) fork, it's currently just local to your
 computer. Click 'Sync' to do that (this is what 'git push' will do in the
 below cmd line instructions). 

Git: Alternatively, you can save and close the file, which should be within your
 ScholarshipSystem directory (the repository directory). If it isn't, you
 won't be able to stage it for committing. From within the repo directory,
 type 'git add [file name or path]'. Type 'git status' to check that the
 file has been staged. If everything's good (you've staged what you wanted
 to stage, and nothing else), then type 'git commit -m "[message here]"' to
 commit your changes. Type 'git push' to push them to your fork.

Both: Finally, go online to your fork on Github, where you should see the changes
 you've just made/committed and click 'send pull request' to merge your
 changes with the master branch of the project.

Tada!

Happy coding!
